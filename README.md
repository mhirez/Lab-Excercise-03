## Project Overview

This project implements a **Singly Linked List** in Java and demonstrates its usage through various operations. It includes the following functionalities:

1. Define an integer singly linked list.  
2. Add items (at least four).  
3. Display all items.  
4. Remove one item.  
5. Display the sum of items.  
6. Delete the entire list.  
7. Count the occurrences of a given item.  
8. Check if two singly linked lists are identical.  
9. Remove duplicates from the list.

The program contains a `SingleLinkedList` class that defines the linked list structure and methods to perform the specified operations.

---

## Features

1. **Add Items**  
   - Adds integers to the end of the linked list using the `addLast(int value)` method.

2. **Display Items**  
   - Prints all items in the list in a readable format with the `display()` method.

3. **Remove an Item**  
   - Removes the first occurrence of a given value using the `remove(int value)` method.

4. **Display the Sum of Items**  
   - Calculates the sum of all integer values in the list using the `getSum()` method.

5. **Delete the Entire List**  
   - Deletes all nodes by clearing the list using the `deleteList()` method.

6. **Count Occurrences of an Item**  
   - Counts how many times a specific value occurs in the list using the `countOccurrences(int value)` method.

7. **Check Identical Lists**  
   - Compares two singly linked lists to see if they are identical (contain the same elements in the same order) using the `isIdentical(SingleLinkedList other)` method.

8. **Remove Duplicates**  
   - Removes repeated values in the list, leaving only the first occurrence of each using the `removeDuplicates()` method.

---

## How to Run the Project

1. **Compile** the Java file (assuming the file is named `SingleLinkedList.java`):
   ```bash
   javac SingleLinkedList.java
   ```

2. **Run**:
   ```bash
   java SingleLinkedList
   ```

3. The program will execute the linked list operations and display the results in the console.

---

## Code Structure

The project consists of a single Java file containing:

1. **`Node` Class**  
   - Represents each element of the linked list with two fields: `data` (integer value) and `next` (pointer to the next node).

2. **`SingleLinkedList` Class**  
   - Contains methods for all required operations and a `main` method to test and demonstrate these operations.

---

## Sample Execution Output

The following is an example of the console output generated by running the program:

```
Initial List:
List Items: 10 -> 20 -> 10 -> 30 -> 40
Removed 20? true
List Items: 10 -> 10 -> 30 -> 40
Sum of items: 90
Occurrences of 10: 2
Is list identical to list2? true
Removing duplicates from first list...
List Items: 10 -> 30 -> 40
Deleting the entire list...
List is empty.
```

---

## Testing and Demonstration

All operations are tested in the `main` method, as follows:

1. **Create the List**  
   - Adds at least four items to the list: `10, 20, 10, 30`.

2. **Display Items**  
   - Prints the initial list.

3. **Remove an Item**  
   - Removes the first occurrence of `20` and displays the updated list.

4. **Display the Sum of Items**  
   - Calculates and prints the sum of all integers in the list.

5. **Count Occurrences**  
   - Counts how many times the value `10` occurs in the list.

6. **Check Identical Lists**  
   - Creates another linked list and checks if it is identical to the first list.

7. **Remove Duplicates**  
   - Removes repeated values from the first list and displays the updated list.

8. **Delete the Entire List**  
   - Deletes all nodes in the list and confirms it is empty.
